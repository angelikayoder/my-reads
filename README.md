# MyReads Project

This is Angelika Yoder's "My Reads" project for Udacity's Front End Nanodegree Program.
It's a bookshelf app, built with React,  that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The main page also has a link to a search page that allows you to find books to add to your library.

To get started viewing the project:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

After completing the previous steps, the project can be viewed on http://localhost:3000/
